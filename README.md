# DateHexConverter

The program is a specialized Python application designed to generate dates from a specific start date up until the present day. It utilizes the built-in datetime module in Python to incrementally generate these dates.
Each generated date is rendered in multiple formats, providing versatile representations suitable for a variety of applications or requirements. Formats include standard notations like DD.MM.YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YY, as well as a complete written form with full weekday and month names.
Following the formatting stage, each date representation is then transformed into a 256-bit hexadecimal value using a SHA-256 hashing function. 

This conversion process generates unique identifiers for each date, facilitating their usage in tasks such as encryption, comparison, or secure record-keeping.
Finally, the resulting hexadecimal values are stored line-by-line into a text (.txt) file. 
This provides a persistent and easily accessible record of the computed data, allowing for subsequent retrieval, analysis, or utilization in other processes.
